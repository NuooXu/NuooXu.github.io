# 问题描述
Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.

If you were only permitted to complete at most one transaction (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock), design an algorithm to find the maximum profit.

Note that you cannot sell a stock before you buy one.

Example 1:  
Input: [7,1,5,3,6,4]  
Output: 5  
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.Not 7-1 = 6, as selling price needs to be larger than buying price.

Example 2:  
Input: [7,6,4,3,1]  
Output: 0  
Explanation: In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.

# 解法一（低效，不推荐）
两层for循环：  
第一次for循环遍历数组  
内for循环，当前值以后的所有值  
在保证第二次遍历的值大于第一次遍历的值的前提下，计算出最大利润。若sell都小于等于buy的话，就会返回初始设置的max即为0.
```java
class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        if(prices == null || prices.length < 1) return 0;
        
        int max = 0, temp = 0;
        //traversing the array to get the buy price
        for(int i = 0;i < prices.length;i++){
            int buy = prices[i];
            //traversing elements after the buy price
            for(int j = i;j < prices.length;j++){
                int sell = prices[j];
                //count the max profit
                if(buy < sell){
                    temp = sell - buy;
                    if(temp > max){
                        max = temp;
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        return max;
    }
}
```

虽然通过了，但是复杂度太高。
# 解法二
解法一的优化版，只用了一层for循环，大大的提升了效率。一次循环，一边找最小值，一边同时算最大利润。
```java
class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        if(prices == null || prices.length < 1) return 0;
        
        int min = prices[0], max = 0;
        for(int i =1; i < prices.length;i++){
            if(prices[i] > min){
                max = Math.max(max,prices[i] - min);
            }else{
                min = prices[i];
            }
        }
        return max;
    }
}

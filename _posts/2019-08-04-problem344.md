# 问题描述
Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters char[].

Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

You may assume all the characters consist of printable ascii characters.

Example 1:  
Input: ["h","e","l","l","o"]  
Output: ["o","l","l","e","h"]  
# 解决思路

```java
class Solution {
    public void reverseString(char[] s) {
        int i = 0;
        int j = s.length - 1;
        while(i<j){
            char temp = s[i];
            s[i] = s[j];
            s[j] = temp;
            i++;
            j--;
        }
    }
}
```

# 问题描述
There are a row of n houses, each house can be painted with one of the three colors: red, blue or green. The cost of painting each house with a certain color is different. You have to paint all the houses such that no two adjacent houses have the same color.

The cost of painting each house with a certain color is represented by a n x 3 cost matrix. For example, costs[0][0] is the cost of painting house 0 with color red; costs[1][2] is the cost of painting house 1 with color green, and so on... Find the minimum cost to paint all houses.

Note:
All costs are positive integers.

Example:  
Input: [[17,2,17],[16,16,5],[14,3,19]]  
Output: 10  
Explanation: Paint house 0 into blue, paint house 1 into green, paint house 2 into blue. 
             Minimum cost: 2 + 5 + 3 = 10.
# 解决思路

分别算三个颜色开头的最小值，再从这三个值里取最小值。
```java
class Solution{
    public int minCost(int[][] costs){
        if (costs == null || costs == 0) return 0;

        int n = costs.length;
        int[][] f = new int[n][3];
        f[0][0] = costs[0][0];
        f[0][1] = costs[0][1];
        f[0][2] = costs[0][2];

        for(int i = 1; i < n;i++){
            //red
            f[i][0] = Math.min(f[i - 1],f[i - 1][2] + costs[i][0]);
            //blue
            f[i][1] = Math.min(f[i - 1],f[i - 1][2] + costs[i][0]);
            //green
            f[i][2] = Math.min(f[i - 1],f[i - 1][1] + costs[i][0]);
        }
        renturn Math.min(f[n-1][0],f[n-1][1],f[n-1][3]);
    }
}
```

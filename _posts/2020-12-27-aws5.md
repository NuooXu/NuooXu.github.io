# Session 4

## 33. Scalability and High Availability

Scalability means that an application / system can handle greater loads by adapting.

### Vertical Scalability (scale up)

Vertically scalability means increasing the size of the instance, like:t2.micro -> t2.large  
Vertical scalability is very common for non distributed systems, such as a database.

### Horizontal Scalability (scale out)

Horizontal Scalability means increasing the number of instances / systems for your application, like: Auto Scaling Group, Load Balancer  
Horizontal scaling implies distributed systems.  
This is very common for web applications / modern applications

### High Availablity

High Availability usually goes hand in hand with horizontal scaling, like: Auto Scaling Group multi AZ, Load Balancer multi AZ  
High availability means running your application / system in at least 2 data centers (== Availability Zones)  
The goal of high availability is to survive a data center loss

## 34. Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)

Load balancers are servers that forward internet traffic to multiple servers (EC2 Instances) downstream.

Health Checks are crucial for Load Balancers:  
• They enable the load balancer to know if instances it forwards traffic to are available to reply to requests  
• The health check is done on a port and a route (/health is common)  
• If the response is not 200 (OK), then the instance is unhealthy

AWS has 3 kinds of managed Load Balancers:

### 35. Classic Load Balancer (v1 - old generation) - Lab

• HTTP, HTTPS, TCP  
• Health checks are TCP or HTTP based  
• Fixed hostname XXX.region.elb.amazonaws.com

### 36. Application Load Balancer (v2 - new generation) - Lab\*

HTTP, HTTPS, WebSocket  
Fixed hostname (XXX.region.elb.amazonaws.com)  
• Load balancing to multiple HTTP applications across machines (target groups)  
• Load balancing to multiple applications on the same machine (ex: containers)

Routing tables to different target groups:  
• Routing based on path in URL (example.com/users & example.com/posts)  
• Routing based on hostname in URL (one.example.com & other.example.com)  
• Routing based on Query String, Headers (example.com/users?id=123order=false)  
ALB are a great fit for micro services & container-based application (example: Docker & Amazon ECS)  
ALB can route to multiple target groups  
Health checks are at the target group level

### 37. Network Load Balancer (v2 - new generation) - Lab

• TCP, TLS (secure TCP) & UDP  
• Forward TCP & UDP traffic to your instances (used for extreme performance)  
• Handle millions of request per seconds

NLB has one static IP per AZ, and supports assigning Elastic IP

Overall, it is recommended to use the newer / v2 generation load balancers as they provide more features

## 38. ELB - Stickiness

It is possible to implement stickiness so that the same client is always redirected to the same instance behind a load balancer  
• This works for Classic Load Balancers & Application Load Balancers  
• The “cookie” used for stickiness has an expiration date you control  
• Use case: make sure the user doesn’t lose his session data  
set in the target group

## 39. ELB - Cross-Zone Load Balancing

With Cross Zone Load Balancing: each load balancer instance distributes evenly across all registered instances in all AZ

Classic Load Balancer
• Disabled by default  
• No charges for inter AZ data if enabled

Application Load Balancer  
• Always on (can’t be disabled)  
• No charges for inter AZ data

Network Load Balancer  
• Disabled by default  
• You pay charges ($) for inter AZ data if enabled

Set it in load banlancer -> description -> cross-zone load balancing

## 40. ELB - SSL

An SSL Certificate allows traffic between your clients and your load balancer to be encrypted in transit  
SSL refers to Secure Sockets Layer, used to encrypt connections  
TLS refers toTransport Layer Security,which is a newer version  
Like: HTTPS, s means be encrypted by ssl

## 42 & 43. Auto Scaling Group (ASG) - Lab

The goal of an Auto Scaling Group (ASG) is to:  
• Scale out (add EC2 instances) to match an increased load  
• Scale in (remove EC2 instances) to match a decreased load  
• Ensure we have a minimum and a maximum number of machines running  
• Automatically Register new instances to a load balancer

ASG attributes:  
 A launch configuration:  
 • AMI + InstanceType  
 • EC2 User Data  
 • EBSVolumes  
 • Security Groups  
 • SSH Key Pair  
Min Size / Max Size / Initial Capacity  
Network + Subnets Information  
Load Balancer Information  
Scaling Policies

Auto Scaling Rules:  
• Target Average CPU Usage  
• Number of requests on the ELB per instance  
• Average Network In  
• Average Network Out  
• custom metrics

Having instances under an ASG means that if they get terminated for whatever reason, the ASG will automatically create new ones as a replacement.
